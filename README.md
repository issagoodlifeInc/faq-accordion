## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Laptop-first workflow

### What I learned

My knowledge of javascript is shallow, had no clue how to create classes to help in the accordion dropdown ....had to use a timeout to handle that ...

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

Not proud of this js code :- need help to deal with this :::

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= seeContent.length; i++) {
  seeContent[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log("i'm clicked!!");

  seeContent[i].style.transform = "rotateX(180deg)";
  faqHead[i].style.color = "var(--darkgrayishblue)";
  faqContent[i].style.visibility = "visible";
  faqContent[i].style.display = "block";

    // seeContent.forEach(function(content){
    //   content.show(".faqContent");
    setTimeout(function(){
      seeContent[i].style.transform = "rotateY(180deg)";
      faqHead[i].style.color = "var(--verydarksatblue)";
      faqContent[i].style.visibility = "hidden";
      faqContent[i].style.display = "none";

    },3000);
  });
}
}
```

### Continued development

My Javascript handling of events on the page needs to improve quite a lot

Mobile first workflow for ease of page making so as not to use a lot of media queries

Not throwing paddings needlessly for page perfection

General handling of markup Used a lot of unnecessary divs
